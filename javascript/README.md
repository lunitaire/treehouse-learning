>2. *Plan* - where we plan out the solution
>3. *Perform* - where we perform what's required in our proposed solution
>4. *Perfect* - where we perfect the solution

#####DOM actions
* __Manipulation__ - where we manipulate elements
* __Traversal__ - selecting an element based on the relationship with another element
* __Events__ - listening to a specific event, like a mouse click or a key press, and having something execute in response

##### Four ways that "this" takes a value
* In normal function calls
