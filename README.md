All of the work I did for the Ruby Development Track is uploaded into this repository. I am still sorting through the PHP and Python work in order to update and upload it. I have been working on the Full Stack JavaScript Track off and on since Fall 2015. It requires a lot more projects to finish than the others, and it also includes other subjects including AJAX, Node.js, and more.
